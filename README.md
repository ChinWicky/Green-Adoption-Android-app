# Green Adoption-Android-app
This repository contains the source code for the Green Adoption Android app.  

You will need JDK 1.8+ installed to work with it. Gradle, Android SDK, and project dependencies will be downloaded automatically.

## Introduction
- My project is a graduation design project from my undergraduate studies. 
- The purpose of this project is to provide a platform for farmers to sell their agricultural products directly to consumers. 
- This platform can help farmers better process their products, and also provide urban residents with healthier food options.  
- The project can be opened in Android Studio 3.0.1, and the properties in the Gradle file can be modified to values that are suitable for the user's computer.
- Currently, the code pages are designed to support Chinese.

## Design pattern
This Android client adopts the MVVM design pattern, dividing the software into three main layers: 
- the View layer (presentation layer) 
- the ViewModel layer (core business logic layer)
- the Model layer (model layer and network interface layer)


programming language
JAVA

Network request
